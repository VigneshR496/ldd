procfs (Process Filesystem):
Purpose:

The /proc filesystem (procfs) is used to expose information about processes and other system information.
It provides a mechanism to access process-specific information (such as process IDs, memory usage, CPU usage) and kernel-related information (such as kernel parameters, hardware information).
Contents:

The contents of /proc are generated on-the-fly and reflect the current state of the system.
Examples include /proc/cpuinfo (CPU information), /proc/meminfo (memory information), and /proc/[pid] directories (information about specific processes).
Interface:

The procfs provides a text-based interface that is easy to read and manipulate using standard user-space tools like cat, grep, and echo.
Examples:

Reading system information: cat /proc/cpuinfo
Reading process information: cat /proc/1234/status (information about process with PID 1234)
Location:

The procfs filesystem is mounted at /proc.
sysfs (System Filesystem):
Purpose:

The /sys filesystem (sysfs) is used to expose the system's device tree and kernel objects, providing a unified view of the kernel's device model.
It helps in managing devices, device drivers, and other kernel subsystems.
Contents:

The contents of /sys represent the hierarchy of devices and their attributes. It provides a structured view of the kernel's device model.
Examples include /sys/class (device classes), /sys/block (block devices), and /sys/devices (physical devices).
Interface:

The sysfs provides a hierarchical view with directories and files, where each file typically represents a single attribute of a device.
It is designed to be both human-readable and machine-parseable.
Examples:

Reading a device attribute: cat /sys/class/net/eth0/operstate
Setting a device attribute: echo "1" > /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
Location:

The sysfs filesystem is mounted at /sys.
Kernel Space vs User Space:
Kernel Space:

Both procfs and sysfs are implemented in the kernel space, meaning they are part of the kernel and provide interfaces to kernel data structures.
Kernel space refers to the memory area where the core of the operating system runs and has unrestricted access to hardware.
User Space:

The files and directories exposed by procfs and sysfs are accessible from user space, meaning user programs can read from and write to these files to interact with the kernel.
User space refers to the memory area where user applications run, with restricted access to the system hardware and kernel memory.
Summary:
procfs is primarily used for process and system information, providing a straightforward text-based interface.
sysfs is used for representing the device model and kernel objects, offering a hierarchical and attribute-based view.
Both filesystems are implemented in kernel space but are accessible from user space for interaction with the kernel.
