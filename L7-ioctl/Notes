OS seperates the virutal memory into kernel space and userspace

There are many ways to communicate between user space and kernel space and one of them is IOCTL (Input and Output Control)

Steps involved in IOCTL
    Create IOCTL command in driver
    Write IOCTL function in the driver
    Create IOCTL command in a userspace application
    Use the IOCTL system call in userspace application

To define a IOCTL name
#define "ioctl name" __IOX("magic number","command number","argument type")


ioctl function that needs be added in the driver
int  ioctl(struct inode *inode,struct file *file,unsigned int cmd,unsigned long arg)


In user space application, we have to define the IOCTL command similar to how it was done in the driver

to call the ioctl command from userspace application
long ioctl( "file descriptor","ioctl command","Arguments");



sudo ./test_user_space
