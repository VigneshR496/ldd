In Linux all devices/hardware peripherals are treated as files, and all character and block devices have a Major and Minor number.


Major number (12-bit) can refer to the driver and minor number(20-bit) can refer to multiple devices which use the same driver.


int register_chrdev_region(dev_t first, unsigned int count, char *name); - used to assign static major number for our driver

int alloc_chrdev_region(dev_t *dev, unsigned int first minor, unsigned int count, char *name); - used to get major number dynamically assigned


void unregister_chrdev_region(dev_t first, unsigned int count); to free the device numbers.
